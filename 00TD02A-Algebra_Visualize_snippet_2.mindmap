root((Algebra))
  Solving Linear Equations
    Form: ax + b = 0
    Solution: Isolate x
    Example: x = -b/a
  Solving Quadratic Equations
    Form: ax^2 + bx + c = 0
    Solution: Quadratic Formula
      Formula: x = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a
    Example: 3x^2 - 2x - 5 = 0
      Solution: x = (2 ± √(4 + 60)) / 6
      Result: x = 5/3 or x = -1
