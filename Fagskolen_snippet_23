* **Explanation:** The LM35 sensor produces an analog voltage proportional to the temperature. The code reads this voltage, converts it to Celsius, and prints it to the serial monitor.

**Advanced Projects**

* **Home Automation:** Control lights, appliances, and more using your Arduino. You'll need relays, sensors, and possibly a Wi-Fi module.
* **Robotics:** Build simple or complex robots that move, sense their environment, and interact with it.
* **Data Logging:** Use sensors to collect data and store it on an SD card or send it to a cloud service.

**Troubleshooting Tips**

* **Board Not Responding:**
    * Check your USB connection.
    * Ensure you've selected the correct board and port in the Arduino IDE.
    * Try pressing the reset button on the board.
* **Incorrect Wiring:**
    * Double-check your circuit connections against the project diagram. 
    * Make sure components are oriented correctly.
* **Code Errors:** 
    * Read the error messages carefully.
    * Look for typos or missing semicolons.
